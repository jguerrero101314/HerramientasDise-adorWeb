Usage
Add the following line to your HTML <head> tag:

<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="https://cdn.rawgit.com/moqmar/weather.css/master/weather.min.css">


Now you can use any container with class="weather rain" or class="weather snow" and it will snow or rain inside it! ;)


Example
For a working example, have a look at http://moqmar.github.io/weather.css/
